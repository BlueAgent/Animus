* Componentalizer
	Tells you what base items are required to craft an item. 
* Drink liquid LP to get a health buff
* LP Chunkloaders
	Include lots of logging, configs, and commands
* Sickles to harvest wheat on right click in their range level
* Death hive, put bees in, pump blood out.
* Drip drive for villagers, IV to slowly gain blood from them
* Trash can container that cleans its inv on server wipe
	Just don't run saveNBTData
* Ritual of chance
	Generates a random at the cost of 15m lp and some other reagents
* Goat mob to give lots of LP when sacrificed by hand
* Enchanting ritual osmosis style
* Sigil to remove wither effect
* Mob Spawning ritual
	Increases rate at which mobs spawn, cursed earth style
* Corporeal Alteration Engine 
	Complex Spell component, converts applicable matter in it's AOE to another type of matter. Input and output would be one of the four elemental blocks, to tell it what to target. (For instance Ice Maker and Earth Former on the input and output respectively would convert any water source blocks in the AOE into stone or dirt, Crucible of Fire -> Wind Generator converts lava source blocks into glass, etc.)
* Ritual of the Distant Scapegoat
	imprison a mob in a Ritual of Containment with the Scapegoat ritual around it. (Above/below, whatever shape works out best.) If the Blood Mage is slain, their captive dies instead and the Mage is returned to full health. Probably best to code it to kill everything trapped in the ritual at once so that some joker doesn't just throw 40 mobs in at once and run around like they're an immortal with a death wish.
* Bound Tool ability inhibitor
	Removes right click ability of bound pick when enabled
* More altar runes
	Runes to improve altar function if it is day/night
* Assembly riual
	Give item to ritual, get blueprint. Give blueprint and all raw resources, autocrafts item.
* Construction sigil
	Gammel: Recursive cobble destruction, touch one all dissapear
* Blood Furnace
	for caco, magical crops speed furnaces for lp cost. infusing previous tier furnace starting with vanilla in an altar would be the recipe

	//TODO: Fix dirtchest transferstackinslot function, uses wrong slot placement code
