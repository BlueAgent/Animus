* Componentalizer

* Ritual of the Distant Scapegoat
	imprison a mob in a Ritual of Containment with the Scapegoat ritual around it. (Above/below, whatever shape works out best.) If the Blood Mage is slain, their captive dies instead and the Mage is returned to full health. Probably best to code it to kill everything trapped in the ritual at once so that some joker doesn't just throw 40 mobs in at once and run around like they're an immortal with a death wish.
