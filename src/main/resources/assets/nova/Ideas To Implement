[20:53:48] <Vindex> (did I mention auto-spawners OPness)
[20:53:49] <Vindex> ?
[20:59:11] <Teamy> lol
[20:59:18] <Teamy> im thinking of adding a mob spawning system
[20:59:22] <Teamy> not sure how to balance it tho
[21:00:54] <Vindex> you just can't
[21:01:41] <Teamy> :(
[21:04:40] <+TheMadman> Well, there is one option: Have it spawn at the same rate as natural spawns, with the only exeption that a player doesn'
[21:04:46] <+TheMadman> t need to be close by.
[21:05:47] <+TheMadman> So it is slow, but a darkroom is just as effective, except the restriction of player distance.
[21:05:54] <Hydrattler> does that mean also using the usual cap for natural spawns? (iirc theres something along them lines)
[21:06:10] <+TheMadman> Yes, that as well.
[21:06:21] <Teamy> only a certain ammount of creatures allowed near a spawner until it stops
[21:06:58] <Teamy> so if you wanted to "autospawn" wither skeletons, they would spawn in the area but at a vanilla rate?
[21:07:51] <+TheMadman> Na, remove the concept of selected spawns. At best, have it weighted.
[21:08:38] <Teamy> So it just promotes spawning in an area with a chance at getting what you want?
[21:08:51] <+TheMadman> Bingo.
[21:09:28] <Teamy> neat, thanks

[21:10:19] <+TheMadman> Also, if it has a cost, have a passive drain with a power spike when a mob spawns.
