It's been nearly a month since my resources stopped loading. After many attempts I have managed to get it working.
I will now document the procedure which I believe rectified the issue:
    •Add the following to build.gradle:
        idea { module { inheritOutputDirs = true } }
    •Run the following gradle commands:
        gradle setupDecompWorkspace idea --refresh-dependencies
        gradle setupDevWorkspace idea --refresh-dependencies
        gradle idea
    •(re)import the gradle project. (Blue arrows on gradle idea tab)
